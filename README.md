# Serpent Logic

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Snake Game** powered by **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Instead of using traditional logic-based approaches, the snake learns to play the game by interacting with its environment and improving its strategy over time. The goal of the project is to showcase how RL can be applied to solve games and develop intelligent agents.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** The snake learns to navigate and grow by maximizing rewards and avoiding penalties.
- **Custom Environment:** A custom Snake Game environment simulates the game mechanics for training the RL model.
- **Visualization:** Watch the agent play the game after training, showcasing its learned behavior.
- **Training Pipeline:** Step-by-step RL model training using a reward-based system.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pygame`: For creating and visualizing the Snake Game environment.
  - `numpy`: For efficient data manipulation.
  - `pytorch`: For implementing and training advanced RL models.
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithm:**
  - Utilizes Q-learning or Deep Q-learning (DQN) to train the agent.

## How It Works
### Snake Game Mechanics
- **Environment:** The game grid contains a snake, food, and empty spaces.
- **Objective:** The snake must eat food to grow while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself.

### Reinforcement Learning Integration
1. **State Representation:**
   - The state includes the snake's position, food location, and obstacles (walls/self).
   - Example: A grid-based representation with relative distances.

2. **Actions:**
   - The snake can take one of four actions: Move up, down, left, or right.

3. **Reward System:**
   - Positive Reward: Eating food.
   - Negative Reward: Colliding with walls or itself.
   - Small Penalty: Moving without eating (to discourage aimless movement).

4. **Learning Process:**
   - The agent explores the environment, takes actions, and receives feedback through rewards and penalties.
   - Q-values are updated using the Bellman equation or a neural network in DQNs.

### Training Workflow
1. Initialize the Q-table or neural network.
2. Simulate episodes of the game.
3. Update Q-values or train the neural network based on rewards.
4. Gradually improve the agent's performance through exploration and exploitation.

### Gameplay
After training, the agent can play the Snake Game autonomously. It demonstrates strategic behavior such as avoiding obstacles, chasing food, and optimizing its path.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
